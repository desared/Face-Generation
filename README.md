# Face-Generation

This is the final Udacity Project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree. It consist of generating new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. 
The goal is to generate new faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA). 

## Steps:

1. Import and pre-process the datasets
2. Create a data loader
3. Define the model (Discriminator and Generator)
4. Define the real and fake losses, respective optimizers
5. Build and train the complete network
6. Evaluate by generating samples from training
